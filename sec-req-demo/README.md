# Security Requirements Demo

This is a very simple website and webservice which uses an ASVS CSV and the GRAPHML representaion of CAPEC and ASVS
in order to map consequences to ASVS controls.

ASVS should be placed in the data directory (needs to be accessible to the website), the GRAPHML file can be where
it would be if manually built using the code in this repo.

When the data are in the correct folders, run main.py, this hosts a website (and web services) on port 2300 on 
the localhost.
